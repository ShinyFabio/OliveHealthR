# OliveHealthR

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of OliveHealthR is to analyze and map all the information obtained from the [OliveHealth](https://olivehealth.it) project. The planned activities will concern the mapping of the olive groves of the 5 Campania provinces (Italy) and the analysis of the health component (eg polyphenols) on samples such as leaves, drupes and oil.

## Installation


1. Install devtools if not already installed.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

2. Install Rtools from this link:

    https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools


3. Now you can install OliveHealthR from [GitHub](https://github.com/ShinyFabio/OliveHealthR2) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ShinyFabio/OliveHealthR2")
```
Be sure that your R version is at least 4.0.0.


### Ubuntu (tested on 18.04)

If your OS is Ubuntu you have to perform some additional steps. In command line run these lines:

``` r
sudo apt install build-essential libcurl4-gnutls-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev   #for {devtools} library
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev                                            #for {Cairo} library
sudo apt-get install libxt-dev                                                #for {Cairo} library
sudo apt install libudunits2-dev                                              #for {units} library
sudo apt install libgdal-dev                                                  #for {sf} library

```


## Launch

To launch the app use this code


``` r
library(OliveHealthR2)
OliveHealthR2::run_OliveHealthR()
```

## How to use

This shiny app performs various analysis and plotting based on files being uploaded. For now OliveHealthR accepts 4 different csv files, one is mandatory and contains all the info about the companies (name, id, coordinates...), the others 3 are different type of data.

### "File aziende (.csv)"
The most important file is "2_Dati_monitoraggio.csv". In order to make the app work, this csv file has some columns that have to follow some writing rules. The following columns are mandatory:

- __"Codice_azienda"__ filled with the code of the company (eg SA_01, AV_12 etc.)
- __"Azienda"__ filled with the name (eg. Az.Agr.Perretta_Nicola). Don't use "-" or spaces in the name
- __"Provincia"__ filled with the province (eg. SA, AV)
- __"UTM_33T_E"__ filled with the UTM 33T East coordinate
- __"UTM_33T_N"__ filled with the UTM 33T North coordinate
- __"Cultivar_principale"__ filled with the main cultivar (use "_" instead of space)


### "File descrizione .csv"

This is an optional csv file containing some info about companies. It contains:

- __"Codice_azienda"__ same
- __"Descrizione"__ filled with the description of the company
- __"Contatti"__ filled with the phone number, email and others infos


### "file CSV con dati drupe"

Here you can upload the phenological phase and ripening index extracted from the record cards. It follows the following structure:

- __"Codice_azienda"__ same
- __"N_campionamento"__ filled with "R1" or "R2" where R1 refers to the first sampling (September/October) and R2 refers to the last sampling (end of October/beginning of November i.e. when the olives are completely ripe)
- __"Data_campionamento"__ filled with the sampling date (in the form of dd/mm/yyyy)
- __"Fase_fenologica"__ (filled with a number)
- __"Indice_maturazione"__ (filled with a number)
- __"Note"__ filled with possible notes

### "file CSV con dati polifenoli"

Here you can upload the polyphenols datas. The csv file follows this structure:

- __"Codice_azienda"__ same
- __"N_campionamento"__ same
- __"Polifenoli_tot"__ filled with the concentration of total polyphenols (mg/g drupes)
- __"Presenza_larve"__ filled with the larvae presence indicator (from 0 to 2)
- Various polyphenols (eg. "Acido_Gallico"). unit of measure: ug/ml of oil








## Other 

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
